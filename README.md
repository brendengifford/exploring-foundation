Git to know you

Things to do for the group:

<ol>

<li>Get everyone involved on this git repository.</li>

<li>Edit some common documents</li>

<li>Everyone should find their interface of choice for editing / contributing to this repo (github app, commandline, etc).</li>

<li>Get your IDE of choice together.  Not everyone needs to be in VIM!  Whatever makes you happy.</li>

<li>Consider roles you want to focus on. (coordinator, tech lead, QA, .js, design, etc)  Obviously the project itself will determine your role needs, but it's good to know what you're interested in going into the project.</li>

<li>Write something EVERY DAY.  Even if it's just a small excercise on Code Academy, or just making small programs for yourself in your own repository -- the more you write, the easier it becomes to generate code you're happy with.</li>

</ol>
