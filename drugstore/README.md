# DRUGSTORE

Let's see how much of the site I can get built in ~~a few~~ 6ish hours.. 

Trying to make the design responsive was pretty difficult. Trying to get the images right was rough. Over all though, I thought the framework was solid and very helpful.

It would have been easier to have an idea of what the mobile versions of the site were supposed to look like I think.
