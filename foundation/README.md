<h2>Pros and Cons of using the Foundation framework</h2>

<ul>
	<li><b>PRO:</b> Has a JS slider built into it</li>
	<li><b>PRO:</b> Built-in responsive design. Which is pretty meh tbh.</li>
	<li><b>PRO:</b> Many useful built-in styles.</li>
	<li><b>CON:</b> Have to overwrite many styles to get what you want... Seriously a pain in the ass.</li>
	<li><b>CON:</b> Strange things are happening to the image sizes and I have to dig in to see what's the trouble.</li>
	<li><b>PRO:</b> Grid system is pretty easy</b></li>
	<li><b>CON:</b> Except, oops I need a four column for the footer nav while I've been using columns that divide evenly into 6 comlumns the whole time. wat do. just leave the grid I guess</li>
</ul>

<h3>Done Thoughts<h3>

Wireframe done, but didn't get into customizing the responsive design - realized I don't know how we want it to look. Also, didn't get into the JS slider because I just ran out of time. 

I got too into the details I think. I should have been more concerned with the blocks in the grid, but I was doing stuff in the header to try to make it look exact. 

Stopped that attention to detail in the content and just used images to make the major blocks. That was pretty easy, still I feel like I wrote a lot of CSS to get it nearer to looking right.

<a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/kitchen_sink.html">The kitchen sink page</a> was pretty useful in figuring out how to use the default stylings.

Used this <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/Testdrive/Graphics/CSSGradientBackgroundMaker/Default.html">CSS gradient generator</a> for the navigation bar. Just kinda guessed on the colors.
